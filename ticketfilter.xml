        <en>The TicketFilter plugin will allow you to add additional regular expressions that 
            TicketFilter will use locate unique identifiers in received tickets. If a match is found, 
            TicketFilter will use the found identifier to locate existing tickets with the same identifier and 
            add the received email as followup in all tickets that contain that identifier. If configured ticketfilter 
            will try to prevent notifications to be send to prevent email runaway issues, reopen closed tickets with status
            new, or update the ticket to a solved state if specific keywords where found in the received email subject.</en>

        <en>In some scenario's upstream ticket systems or monitoring systems 
            will be owning the origin ticket or asset state sending successive 
            email updates to GLPI. In this scenario the required GLPI identifier 
            (i.e. [GLPI #000001]) is most likely missing. Instead an foreign identifier 
            might be present in the subject. This causes GLPI to create new tickets for 
            each update that is received by email cluttering the ticket pool with duplicates. 
            Ticketfilter uses expressions to automatically add tickets with matching patterns 
            as a ticket followup instead of creating new ones. More features (like automatic asset matching)
            planned.
